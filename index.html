		My main research interests focus on developing <em><b>medical robots</b></em>, <em><b>educational robots</b></em>, <em><b>collaborative robots</b></em>
		      and using technologies like Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML)
		      to solve real world problems through robotics.
		      My Ph.D. research was on <b> Frature-directed steerable needles </b> (compliant needles that can be steered to a target location) 
		      where the following objectives were met: </br> 
	      <ul>
	  <li>Obtained an accuracy of <b> 98% </b> in predicting the motion of Stylet-and-Tube and Waterjet Steerable Needles by 
		  proposing and testing <b> kinematic models </b> based on Screw Theory and matching them with experiments</li>
	   <li>Improved the Radius-of-Curvature, Steerabilty and buckling issue of traditional Steerable Needles by designing 
		      and implementing a <b> Waterjet Needle Steering System </b> (mechanical design in SolidWorks, control software 
		      in Python and C++</li>
           <li>Reduced the error in predicting the cut-depth of the waterjet in soft tissue to <b> less than 2% </b> 
		   by developing a <b> finite element model </b> of the tissue and the needle in ANSYS as well as a 
		   <b> closed-form mathematical model </b> based on the mechanical properties of the soft tissue 
			      (constitutive response and fracture toughness) and the waterjet needle (diameter and velocity)</li>
		      <li>Accurately measured the distance and curvature as well as reconstructed the needle path from the images 
			      by developing an <b> Image Processing Software </b> in MATLAB</li>
		      <li>Decreased the targeting error of the Waterjet Steerable Needle to <b> less than 2 mm </b> by developing 
			      an <b> optimal path planner </b> based on Genetic Algorithm</li>
		      <li>Successfully controlled the Waterjet Steerable Needle to a target by developing a
			      <b> Vision-based control </b> scheme using OpenCV and MATLAB</li>
		      <li>Accurately measured the low-strain-rate and high-strain-rate properties of SEBS soft tissue simulants 
			  by fitting Ogden model to the results of the Static Compression and Split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) tests</li>
		      </ul>
